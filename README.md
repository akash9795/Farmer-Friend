# Farmers Friend : Intelligent Crop Assistant
This is a machine learning project based on k-nearest neighbors. In this project I have tried to solve problem of new Indian Farmers to find the best crop that they can grow in their farms. 
If their is a new guy in the field of farming, then it will be easy for him/her to select the best crop for farming.
In this project we have a dataset crop.xlsx in which we train a K-Nearest Neighbors model which  can predict for almost 22 different types of crop according to the dataset. If we can Implement this project on the ground level then it can help our farmers to grow the best crop according to the condition's.
